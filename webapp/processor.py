# NOTE: Output and temp directory are set to Flask's static folder for image visibility
# This allows the generated images to be displayed directly on the web interface.

# NOTE: Currently there is no stop mechanism â€“ read_blocks runs in an infinite loop.
# To support stopping from the Flask UI, we will need to implement a shared flag (e.g., state.is_observing)
# and check it periodically inside the reading loop.

# NOTE: Discarded blocks (due to step filtering) are currently ignored.
# In the future, we may want to save them as .dat files for post-analysis.

# NOTE: Only one .dat file is processed at the moment.
# We could add support for detecting and switching to new files if needed (e.g., file rotation during observation).

# NOTE: There is no feedback about processing state (e.g., number of images processed).
# Adding counters or logs shown in the web UI could be useful for tracking progress.

# NOTE: Error handling is printed to the console only.
# In future versions, errors could be logged or shown in the web interface.
